# ANKLE-STRAT | Background

This project is about people with chronic ankle instability (CAI), which is a common injury that happens to athletes. People with CAI have trouble with balance and how they stand, especially when they are standing on one foot. 

Single leg balance is an important aspect of daily physical activity, as well as in many sports. The ability to balance on one leg requires coordination, stability, and strength from multiple parts of the body. Good single leg balance skills can help to prevent injuries, improve overall athletic performance, and increase one's ability to perform daily tasks such as reaching for objects, climbing stairs, or walking on uneven surfaces. In sports, single leg balance is especially important for activities that require quick changes of direction, jumping, or pivoting. Developing strong single leg balance skills can also lead to improved stability, power, and agility in other aspects of physical performance. As such, incorporating exercises that challenge single leg balance into one's fitness routine can have a significant impact on overall health and well-being.

The study is looking at how they stand and what factors may influence their balance when they are standing on one foot and when they are doing more challenging balance tasks.
