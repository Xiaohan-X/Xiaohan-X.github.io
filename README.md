# ANKLE-STRAT | Background

This project is about people with chronic ankle instability (CAI), which is a common injury that happens to athletes. People with CAI have trouble with balance and how they stand, especially when they are standing on one foot.

The ability to balance on one leg requires coordination, stability, and strength from multiple parts of the body. Good single leg balance skills can help to prevent injuries, improve overall athletic performance, and increase one's ability to perform daily tasks such as reaching for objects, climbing stairs, or walking on uneven surfaces. In sports, single leg balance is especially important for activities that require quick changes of direction, jumping, or pivoting. Developing strong single leg balance skills can also lead to improved stability, power, and agility in other aspects of physical performance. As such, incorporating exercises that challenge single leg balance into one's fitness routine can have a significant impact on overall health and well-being.


The study is looking at how they stand and what factors may influence their balance when they are standing on one foot and when they are doing more challenging balance tasks.

# ANKLE-STRAT | TEST
### TEST PROCEDURE

If you participate the study

- You will receive a standard questionnaire to screen if you potentially have chronic ankle instability (at Initial meeting).
- You will have a comprehensive physical examination on your ankle (at testing day1). 
- You will receive a battery of balance test (at testing day2).

Your participation will also contribute to a better understanding of how individuals with and without chronic ankle instability control their balance, which can lead to improved treatment options for those with CAI in the future.

### MAIN FACILITY

#### VSimulators

[VSimulators](https://vsimulators.co.uk/) at University of Exeter is a newly commissioned, state-of-the-art multidisciplinary platform for human factors research, combining the ability to recreate motion experienced in the real world, with immersive virtual reality for up to nine occupants. This unique facility is part of a joint venture between Universities of Exeter, Bath and Leicester, delivering two VSimulators facilities, one at the University of Bath and the other at the University of Exeter. The project was funded by a Â£4.8 million grant from the EPSRC (Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council), along with substantial contributions by both Universities.
